# 1 Business Requirements
## 1.1 Background
Planning activities can be an inconvenience for many people; these involve coordinating with the weather and people, 
and the important task of actually finding an exceptional location for these activities. We want to build an application that streamlines the planning process. 
Our vision involves effortless and pain-free activity planning through a web application, named “Outdoor Now”
## 1.2 Business Opportunity
As climate change accelerates and the weather becomes more volatile, cancelling plans will 
become more and more common. Planning in general can be cumbersome, which is why there is a necessity for modernizing the planning experience.
## 1.3 Business Objectives
- To increase user engagement and satisfaction by providing personalized recommendations and real-time weather updates.
- Aim to continuously improve the user experience through the incorporation of user feedback and suggestions. 
- To establish OutdoorNow as a trusted and reliable source for outdoor activity planning in BC and expand to other regions in the future.
## 1.4 Vision Statement
For outdoor enthusiasts who travel through BC, OutdoorNow is an activity planning application that provides a straightforward and engaging outdoor activity planning experience. Our product will aid in the process of planning by allowing users to choose their favourite activities, and presenting possible locations with ratings, all while providing recommendations based on forecasting future weather conditions. When the weather changes drastically, email notifications will allow the users to select rescheduled times alongside fellow outdoor enthusiasts - all driven by powerful weather forecasting data. 
## 1.5 Business Risks
Business risks may include legal risks such as privacy concerns with recording users' addresses, and possible liability involving dangerous topological conditions which result in injury. May also include risks from the dependency that recommendations have on weather data providers and accuracy. 
## 1.6 Business Assumptions and Dependencies
Business dependencies of OutdoorNow would include accurate weather data and adequate information on outdoor activities. The functionality of OutdoorNow depends greatly on weather data as users depend on weather information to make their activity decisions. Additionally, all locations that users have to choose from come from the activity data, location and provider information accessible by the software. 
# 2 Scope and Limitations
## 2.1 Major Features
1) Presenting possible activity locations in your chosen area
2) Presenting possible dates in a calendar based on the user availability, the corresponding activity(ies), and forecasted weather conditions
3) Notify via email and reschedule activities when poor weather conditions reveal
4) Activity locations should be given a difficulty rating after pursued, which can be viewed by other users
## 2.2 Scope of Initial Release
The initial release should provide the main functionality of the system, including accounts, activity selection, and availability selection. UI should prioritize practical utility over aesthetics.
## 2.3 Scope of subsequent releases
Subsequent releases must extend the capabilities in the initial release with email notifications on poor weather conditions, presenting forecasted data for user data-driven decisions, and the rating feature. Eventually, a social network should be available; specifically, user profiles should be able to be customizable, and users should be able to coordinate with other users for planning activities.
## 2.4 Limitations and Exclusions
The system will not extend BC, nor will it account for dangerous topological conditions. (IE avalanche warnings, tsunami alerts, mudslide warnings, etc). The application will not provide a chat function, or an image-sharing platform. The system will not be available as a mobile app.
# 3 Business Context
##  3.1 Stakeholder Profiles
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| New Residents | New residents may be unaware of the area and activities within the area. They may also not have time to explore or plan these activities due to restrictive work hours. |
| New Students | New students may need to be made aware of the area and activities within the area. They may also not have time to explore or plan theses activities due to busy school schedules. |
| Busy Residents or Students | Busy residents of a city may not have time to plan out activities due to low amounts of free time caused by busy work or school schedules |
