Planning a summer trip to Vancouver Island
My partner and I will be visiting Telegraph Cove in July and are wanting to extend our time on the island to explore more places since the ferry is pretty pricey. We plan to spend a week after Telegraph Cove.
Looking for campground recommendations, easy-moderate hikes, travel routes and any other tips/tricks people may have for this trip

Any suggestions for hikes that might still be do-able after heavy rainfall? Heading to Tofino this weekend…. 40-50mm of rain tomorrow.

Hiking in February?
I’m visiting a friend in BC in mid February for 6 days, I want to get some good hikes in and I plan to spend at least a couple days on Vancouver Island. I’m a big tree/mushroom/natural world nerd so any spots that showcase really unique forests or coastal habitats or what have you, then I’m in. I was thinking about doing something like the horne lake caves too. Also looking for a couple good places to stay overnight! Thanks.

Family friendly resort?
Hey all,

I'm taking my in-laws and kids on a trip this spring/summer, and we're looking for a resort that has easy access to activities (whale watching, hikes, etc.), and ideally with easily accessible food that is OK with kids etc. - not crazy fancy.  I know about Tofino resort but I'm not very knowledgeable about the area.   Any advice you all have would be great!   (I should add I technically am OK if its mainland Canada, but would like it close to the water.)

Thanks!

Asking the locals: Have you ever encountered a potential dangerous animal? For example a Bear or a cougar.
I was wondering how often this actually happens (I know the official numbers of attacks) and I would be interested if this is actually a possibility you have in mind when you go for a hike or go jogging?

Best Drive-Up view points on the Island??
I recently moved to Langford and I'm looking for drive-up view points to take my 5 year old daughter for sunrises or sunsets. She is not a fan of hiking in the dark or hikes with steep inclines; but I'd love her to have the experience of a sunrise at altitude. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!

December Road Trip?
Hey all. My wife and I were thinking about doing a road trip and some easy side hikes in either December or even January. Is this a dumb idea? I know to expect rain but is it likely that most of the southern island would be covered in snow? Planning on starting in Victoria and heading to Nanaimo, Port Alberni. Port Renfrew, maybe Lake Cowichan area. Nothing too crazy but not seeing much consistent info online. Thanks in advance.
