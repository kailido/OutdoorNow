Anyone done Elfin lake recently?
How were the conditions of the road to get there and the trail?

Mt Gardner on Bowen Island
I was thinking about doing this hike soon but was wondering if there are any resources you guys have where I could check the current conditions for snow? I only just moved here so I don't know any of the websites or pages to keep and eye on yet! I haven't done much winter hiking so I was hoping snow would be sparse enough seeing as it's not a very high mountain (obviously expecting some just not a massive amount)

Anyone been up the Sea to Summit recently?
I've done it many times in the spring/summer/fall, but never in winter. I'd like to give it a go. 

Checked their weather webcam and confirmed the trail is open already. Avalanche forecast looks to be "Low" to "Moderate" for the next few days. 

I'm expecting a moderate-to-fair amount of snow at the top, with it being pretty snow-free, then slushy and wet early on and packed down and icy further up. 

I'll have poles and microspikes, and might bring snowshoes just in case too - but doubt they'd actually be useful.

Has anyone been up recently, or even just around this time of year in general, who can share a bit about what conditions to expect?

Weekend gateway hiking/camping trip during Easter
Hi everyone, just moved to BC. 

Any recommendations for Easter(7th-9th of April) gateway trip? Camping(or not), hiking, dog friendly and not too cold to stay in a tent or as alternative to book a cabin.  
I have heard a lot of recommendations about gulf islands or simply going to Vancouver island. How about the weather there in early April? 

Appreciate any other recommendations. 

Looking for some nature, great sunsets and beautiful hikes.

Weekly Conditions Thread
**Trip Plans** \- Post trip plans in the comments, and hopefully other users can provide some constructive, helpful feedback. It’s a good way to get recommendations too.

**Snowline**: Variable, but plan for it to be low. 

**Weather Forecasts:** Models are differing with either clear cold weather getting down to -10c on the weekend, or warmer

**Avalanche**: [Avalanche.ca](https://avalanche.ca/). Avalanche risk is HIGH in the alpine into Friday with CONSIDERABLE risk ( high likelihood of human triggered avalanches). BY Saturday the risk is expected to decline to moderate. But the current risk is Persistent Slabs. These are difficult to identify without training and a pit test. They also leads to remote triggers in places like Stratchan Gulley.

**Risks to Look Out For**: AVALANCHES will be less of a risk by the weekend, but be careful of open slopes, and anywhere a small avalanche could trap a hiker in tree well or creek. Also be aware of overhead hazards. Persistent slabs lead to remote triggers where slopes are knocked loose from people bellow. Avoid being under snow loaded slopes. 

WIND - Expect strong winds (20-50 km/h)in the alpine Friday and Saturday. 

**Equipment**: Snowshoes probably aren’t necessary bellow 1200m. Micro spikes with be very helpful if you plan to go above 700m. Trekking poles are also handy for balance.

**Observed Conditions** Based on trip reports from the past week Snow is thin for this time of year with less than a meter reported in most places. Snowshoes are becoming more practical on less travelled trails, but with so little snow most popular routes see enough traffic that they get packed out. Expect icy hard packed snow on most trails. More snow is on the way, but no big dumps are predicted yet. Conditions are unseasonably cold.

Hiking trip in late April?
Hi all - 

I'd love to do a road trip this coming April and hit spots like Panorama Ridge, Sugar Loaf, Norvan Falls, Cathedral Lakes, St. Marks, Lindeman Lake, Brockton Point, Cream Lake, Lake O'Hara, Mt. Assiniboine, Eagle Bluffs, Tunnel Bluffs, Joffre Lakes, Mount Robson. My question is if these would be accessible in late April (21st-29th)? What is the weather typically like/is it good for hiking? Any wildflowers out this time of year? Are the trails still snowy? I've never been, so any advice is helpful.

Thank you for any input.

Weekly Conditions and Trip Plan Nov 30th - Dec 4th
**Trip Plans** \- Post trip plans in the comments, and hopefully other users can provide some constructive, helpful feedback. It’s a good way to get recommendations too.

**Snowline**: Variable, but plan for it to be low

**Weather Forecasts:** Models are differing with either clear cold weather getting down to -10c on the weekend, or warmer 

**Avalanche**: [Avalanche.ca](https://Avalanche.ca) IS BACK ONLINE with some bad news for the early week. Avalanche risk is HIGH in the alpine. Thankfully it should reduce to Moderate at Treeline and above by the weekend due to Storm Slabs. Storm slab is the layer of snow dropped on an older layer. These can detach and even in small  avalanches. It needs a few days to settle. Be aware, there is a NEW APP coming but it has not launched yet. 

**Risks to Look Out For**: The temperatures could drop, so extra layers is imoortant. SHORT DAYS are also a risk. Dark sneaks up. AVALANCHES will be less of a risk by the weekend, but be careful of open slopes, and anywhere a small avalanche could trap a hiker in tree well or creek. 

**Equipment**: Snowshoes probably aren’t necessary bellow 1800m. Micro spikes with be very helpful if you plan to go above 700m. Trekking poles are also handy for balance.

Rain jacket recommendations
In need of a new rain jacket and on a tight budget, less than $250. I looked at the MEC hydrofoil stretch and the REI XeroDry GTX jacket. Any other recommendations?

Generally a fair weather hiker but good to have something decent and for layering up. Any suggestions appreciated.

Conditions and Trip Plan Thread - November 24th
**Trip Plans** \- Post trip plans in the comments, and hopefully other users can provide some constructive, helpful feedback. 

**Snowline**: 800m 

**Weather Forecasts:** Friday and Saturday the freezing level will be 1000-1500m elevation. Light precipitation. Sunday temperature begins to drop with snow forecast next week. 

**Avalanche**: No forecasts out yet. An ACMG guide put out a [Condition Report this week ](https://mountainconditions.ca/reports/look-current-snowpack)that makes not of the “faceted” snowpack. This is sugar like crystals that have low friction. If we get storm slabs there is a high likelihood of persistent slab problems well into January. TBD if this is indeed a threat. 

**Risks to Look Out For**: Slippery trail, Short daylight hours, ankle snappers hidden under snow. 

**Equipment**: Snowshoes probably aren’t necessary bellow 1800m. Micro spikes with be very helpful if you plan to go above 700m. Trekking poles are also handy for balance.

Visitor's Guide to Hiking Vancouver
Welcome to Vancouver. 

For Hiking between November and May please scroll down to Winter Section.

Summer

*(Under Construction)*

**Hiking Vancouver in Winter**

The Mountains around Vancouver can be beautiful in winter. With snowy peaks the views are stunning. However there are plenty of risks that come

 For simple routes we would recommend the [Snowshoe Grouse Grind](https://www.grousemountain.com/snowshoe-grind), Sea to Sky Gondola and [Cypress Trails](https://cypressmountain.com/snowshoeing) as they are maintained and patrolled trails perfect for any ability level. Both have snowshoe rentals on sight, and the trails are well maintained. There is little risk provided users stay on the trails. They are also some of the best options for views. Grouse is easily accessible by Transit ( Seabus from Waterfront, #236 Bus to Grouse base, and then up the gondola. )

For those with some hiking experience there are trails like Dog Mountain, Brockton Point, Hollyburn, Lynn Peak, are close and popular routes. There are more trails, but the main thing to consider is that anything around or above treeline is in avalanche terrain and requires training and equipment. 

There are plenty of **snow free hiking trails**: Jug Island, Lighthouse Park, Bunzten Lake, sometimes Norvan Falls, Lynn Canyon, Rice Lake, Fisherman's Trail, Alder Flats, Pacific Spirit Park, Quarry Rock (If it's open)

Most of the popular trails seen in the summer like Panorama Ridge, Joffre Lakes and St Marks Summit are in Challenging avalanche terrain. Historically they each experience a couple natural slides every year. Hiring a guide, or only going when avalanche risk is low is recommended. 

**Important Safety information**

* **Cellphone signal in the mountains is unreliable**. Pre-downloading maps, and leaving a plan with someone of your intended route is the best guarantee of safety. 
* **It is always recommend to carry the** [**Ten Essentials**](https://www.northshorerescue.com/education/what-to-bring/)**.  The BCADVENTURESMART App or site** is a great resource too.
* **Never head downhill if you are lost**. Local mountains are shaped steeply on the sides. This normally leads people into ravines, and creeks which are extremely dangerous. 
* **Search and Rescue call outs are free in Canada**. In the event of injury, or being very lost Contact [North Shore Search and Rescue](https://www.northshorerescue.com/contact/), Lions Bay Search and Rescue (depending on location). If you aren't sure dial 9-1-1. Make sure to have your coordinates available ( check Compass App). Be mindful, this is **not a taxi service** if you don't know where you are. 
* **Hypothermia is most common in Summer.** Bring extra clothes even if it's hot.  
* **Wildlife is common, but a low risk with proper behaviour.** Bears and Cougars live in the area and are seen often. Never approach them even if they "seem friendly". Travelling in a group, making noise ( just conversing is fine) is the best way to stay safe. Bear Spray is a good tool for providing confidence, though is rarely required. [Animal Guides](https://northshorebears.com/education-guides/)
* **Prepare for Wet Weather**. Waterproof jacket and non cotton clothing should be carried on every hike. Also proper hiking footwear. 

Winter

* **Trails are icy**, or snowed in and likely **require microspikes or snowshoes.** Waterproof footwear and good traction is essential. 
* **Cellphone batteries die rapidly in the cold**. 
* **Avalanches are rare in the trees**, but people have been caught in small avalanches that trap them beneath trees. Check the forecast at [avlanche.ca](https://avlanche.ca) and if the stated Danger Rating is higher than Moderate find a guide, or another activity.

West Canyon Trail to Alder Flats, Golden Ears Provincial Park
There was no snow at the trailhead but there was more snow as we got higher up. Totally doable without microspikes but they did help a bit in the snow at higher elevations.

The conditions were great and we looped around the East Canyon side on the way down which was quite scenic as well.

10/10 great beginner winter hike

Anyone been up to Golden Ears lately?
I was thinking of hiking up to the Alder Flats but I'm not sure of the conditions. Avalanche Canada doesn't have information until November 25 so I'm a bit confused.
---
Anyone been up to Elfin Lakes recently?
Would like to know how much snow is up there currently and what the conditions are like. Thanks!!
