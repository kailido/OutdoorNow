Daytime Activities?
I want to incorporate some sort of regular social/physical activity but I’m having a hard time finding anything that works for my schedule. 

Im a FT mom and I work from home, so the only time that works for me is during the weekday, ideally before lunch. 

I understand why there wouldn’t be demand for things during this time, but I’m hoping there is *some* thing interesting I can find. 

I’m interested in dance classes, art or woodworking classes, board games and other meetups. 

Any ideas?

People who are solo &amp;/or don’t celebrate Christmas, what are your activities or traditions over the next few days?
Just curious if we can compare notes/tips for things we do this time of year. 

I usually make a full Irish breakfast, I always have some themed moviethon every year—this year will John Candy films; first up, Cool Runnings—&amp; I want to go see what the ocean looks like with snow on the beach.

&amp; however you relax or celebrate, I wish you all good things!

Hummingbird feeder tips
This cold snap is hard on our tiny buzzy friends! Here's some tips on how to keep them going, from a local biologist. If you have questions I didn't cover, feel free to ask!

- Some sources say it's ok to go to 1:3 sugar to water, but don't go any higher as high concentrations can be lethal. 

- As soon as ice crystals start to form, your solution becomes more concentrated,  so try to avoid this happening. 

-keep feeder from freezing by wrapping them in an insulated material and putting heat packs around them, wrapping them in incandescent Christmas light, or frequent switching with feeders that have been warming up inside. You can also buy commercial hummingbird heaters. Take feeders in overnight but know that they need calories at first light (getting up early to feed the hummingbirds is a very Victoria activity).

-If you have one bully monopolizing the feeder, consider putting up an additional one around a corner and out of sight. 

-Don't use anything but white sugar and water (no brown sugar, honey, dye etc)

-Keep feeders clean and make sure to sterilize them frequently. A weak bleach solution followed by a good rinse is best. Avoid soaps that can leave residues. Make sure you have a brush to clean the feeding ports, as this is where mould likes to grow.

-Make sure the feeder is in an area that's safe. I've seen feeders put on one side of a glass balcony railing and I can't imagine how many collide with the glass as they go to the feeder.

Should we stay in Victoria or move to Vancouver?
Hey Redditors of Victoria I need your helpful opinions. I find Victoria very, very….. boring. My wife and I have two very young children and although when it isn’t raining, there are some things to do (all of ones you’d probably think of), as soon as the weather gets cold and wet, we have only a couple of options. And there are only so many times one can do the butterfly gardens, museum (which hasn’t changed at all since when I was my kids’ age), Bug Zoo, Miniature World, Playzone, etc before they’re just plain boring. 

So, we’re strongly considering moving to Vancouver (we lived there for a few years before we had kids) simply because there are way more things to do there and closer places to go from there. 

We own a house here in a good neighbourhood and we know that we’ll have to downgrade somewhat to live in a similar neighbourhood in Vancouver. But we’re fine with that if we can have access to so much more (activities, restaurants, things to see, places to go etc). 

My question to you all is, can you convince us to stay here? Or can you convince us to move to Vancouver?

Kids birthday party ideas
Does anyone know of a place for a 6th birthday party with potentially 25 kids? Preferably with activities,  a place for food etc. ? Also something that doesn't require re-mortgaging my house,  because I don't have a house.
