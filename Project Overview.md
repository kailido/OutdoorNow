## Project Overview: Outdoor Now

With busy schedules and daily responsibilities, individuals struggle to find the time to plan and organize outdoor activities. The challenge of finding the time and resources to properly plan a leisurely activity can hinder individuals from taking advantage of their free time and experiencing the great outdoors.

Our website, Outdoor Now, aims to simplify the process of finding the ideal time, weather, and location to enjoy the outdoor activities that you love. Whether you prefer to venture solo or join forces with like-minded adventurers, Outdoor Now offers the flexibility to share and plan your outdoor activities with others.

Outdoor Now will simplify the process by allowing users to select a preferred radius around their location and/or specific locations they want to keep track of. Our software would then monitor the weather and user's availability to suggest the perfect date for their outing. With the help of previous input from the user, the website would make recommendations for activities that match the user's skill level.
