        "description": "This is an outstanding 22 mile long forested singletrack trail connecting the west side of Port Angeles to Lake Crescent.  It is currently a segment of the larger 60 mile long Olympic Discovery Trail.  While not technically difficult it requires stamina to ride for extended distances on the trail.  The trail is quite scenic, with views into the Olympic Mountains, Mount Olympus, Lake Aldwell, Salt Creek and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  It is a flow trail where grades average eight percent or less with quick downhill runs, switchbacks and excellent dry running surface.  You should be prepared with water, tools and pepper spray (in case of cougar encounters).\r\n\r\nThe map below only includes the trail up to its intersection with Joyce-Piedmont Road. From there, it is either possible to bomb the road down to Lake Crescent or continue the trail towards the Lyre River to reach Lake Crescent via singletrack.",

Once on SR 112 you drive 1.5 miles to trailhead beside SR 112 just west of the Elwha River Bridge crossing. Look for wooden entrance sign and kiosk with trail map on left side of the road. You can access the west end of the trail from the center of the Joyce Piedmont Road just south of the Joyce Crescent School or farther west at the Spruce Railroad Trail trailhead on Lake Crescent where you would ride back to the east across the Lyre River bridge and turn south up the Lyre River gravel road for 3 miles to intersect the west end of the singletrack trail.",
